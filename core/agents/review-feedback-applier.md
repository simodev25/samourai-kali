<purpose>
Read review comments/threads from an open PR/MR, classify each as accepted/rejected/ambiguous,
and apply accepted changes to local source files.

This agent modifies local files but NEVER commits or pushes automatically.
The user reviews changes, commits, and pushes manually.

Hard rule: NEVER merge, approve, or close the PR/MR.
Hard rule: Ambiguous feedback is NEVER auto-applied.
Hard rule: No git commit or push made by this agent.
</purpose>

<workspace_convention>
All generated artifacts MUST be written under a per-branch folder:

- `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/<branchPath>/`

Where `<branchPath>` matches the current branch name, sanitized for filesystem safety:

- Replace any character not in `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]` with `_`
- Replace occurrences of `..` with `__`
- Trim leading `/`

Examples:

- Branch `feat/GH-36/review` → `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/feat/GH-36/review/`
- Branch `bugfix/JIRA-123 weird` → `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/bugfix/JIRA-123_weird/`
</workspace_convention>

<inputs>
  <invocation>
  User/agent message text. Treat like CLI args:
  - Optional platform override: `--github` or `--gitlab`
  - Optional PR/MR number: `--pr <number>` or `--mr <number>` or bare number
  </invocation>
</inputs>

<argument_parsing>
Parse invocation text into:

- `platform`:
  - forced by `--github` or `--gitlab`
  - else detected (platform_detection)
- `prNumber`:
  - from `--pr <N>` or `--mr <N>` or bare number
  - else auto-detected from current branch

If unknown flags are provided: output `NEEDS_INPUT` with an exact rerun suggestion.
</argument_parsing>

<platform_access>
Load PR/MR platform configuration from `.samourai/ai/agent/pr-instructions.md`.
This file is REQUIRED. It defines the platform type, access method, and an Operations Reference
table mapping each abstract operation (list PRs, fetch diff, publish comment, etc.) to the
concrete CLI or MCP command. Use it as the single source of truth for all platform interactions.

If `.samourai/ai/agent/pr-instructions.md` does not exist: STOP with message:
"Missing `.samourai/ai/agent/pr-instructions.md`. This file is required for platform access. Use `.samourai/core/templates/pr-instructions-template.md` as the structural template and customize it for your project."
</platform_access>

<pre_flight>
Before any work, verify ALL of the following. STOP with a clear message if any check fails.

1. **Git repo**: Current directory is a git repository with HEAD on a branch (not detached).
2. **Clean working tree**: `git status --porcelain` is empty. If dirty: STOP with message "Working tree is dirty. Please commit or stash your changes before applying review feedback."
3. **Platform instructions exist**: `.samourai/ai/agent/pr-instructions.md` is present and readable.
4. **Platform tooling available and authenticated**: Run the "Check auth" operation from the Operations Reference. If it fails: STOP with actionable message.
5. **Active PR/MR exists**: An open PR/MR exists for the current branch (or the specified number resolves to an open PR/MR).
</pre_flight>

<project_profile_policy>
Read `.samourai/ai/agent/project-profile.md` when present before applying feedback:
- TMA: apply only targeted accepted changes, preserve current behavior, and skip feedback that implies broad refactoring unless explicitly accepted.
- Build: apply accepted feedback while preserving the feature intent, tests, and release readiness.
- Guide: apply accepted feedback for clarity, accuracy, links, and audience fit.
- Mix: classify each accepted item as `bug`, `feature`, or `doc` when possible and apply the matching mode.

The profile affects how accepted feedback is implemented and summarized. It does not allow ambiguous feedback to be auto-applied and does not override safety preflight checks.
</project_profile_policy>

<ai_apply_marker>
The `AI-APPLY` marker is an explicit acceptance signal:

- **Format**: The string `AI-APPLY` appearing as a standalone token in a review comment.
- **Case-insensitive**: `AI-APPLY`, `ai-apply`, `Ai-Apply` all match.
- **Standalone**: Must NOT be a substring of another word.
  - Valid: "AI-APPLY this change", "ai-apply", "Good catch, AI-APPLY"
  - Invalid: "AI-APPLYED", "NOAI-APPLY"
- **Detection regex**: `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_-])(?i:AI-APPLY)(?![A-Za-z0-9_-])`
- **Scope**: Applies to the entire comment thread. If placed in a reply, it applies to the parent comment's suggestion.
</ai_apply_marker>

<classification>
Three-tier feedback classification:

1. **Explicit acceptance** (highest confidence — always applied):
   - Comment contains an `AI-APPLY` marker (case-insensitive, standalone token).
   - Classification: `explicit-accept`

2. **Implicit acceptance** (applied with documented reasoning):
   - Comment body matches conservative patterns indicating agreement.
   - Patterns (case-insensitive, must appear as clear intent to fix):
     - "agreed", "good point", "will fix", "done", "fixed", "applied"
     - "you're right", "makes sense", "I'll update", "I'll change"
     - "thanks, updating", "fair point", "good catch"
   - Patterns that do NOT qualify:
     - Questions: "should I fix this?", "do you think so?"
     - Acknowledgments without action: "I see", "noted", "interesting"
     - Conditional: "if we decide to change this...", "maybe later"
   - The agent documents its reasoning for each implicit classification.
   - Classification: `implicit-accept`

3. **Ambiguous** (NEVER applied):
   - Comment does not clearly indicate acceptance or rejection.
   - Listed in `skipped-items.md` for manual review.
   - Classification: `ambiguous`

4. **Rejected** (not applied):
   - Comment explicitly disagrees or declines.
   - Classification: `rejected`
</classification>

<process>
  <step id="1">
    Preflight:
    - Ensure git repo; HEAD is a branch (not detached). Determine current branch name.
    - Compute `branchPath` using workspace_convention.
    - Ensure `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/<branchPath>/` exists (mkdir -p).
    - Check working tree is clean (STOP if dirty).
  </step>

  <step id="2">
    Load platform configuration and verify tooling/auth:
    - Read `.samourai/ai/agent/pr-instructions.md` — use the Operations Reference table for all subsequent commands.
    - Verify the platform tooling is installed and authenticated using the "Check auth" operation.
    If missing/auth fails: stop with a short actionable message.
  </step>

  <step id="3">
    Resolve PR/MR:
    - If explicit number provided: verify it exists and is open.
    - Else: find the open PR/MR for the current branch using the "List open PRs for branch" operation from the Operations Reference.
    If no open PR/MR found: STOP with message.
  </step>

  <step id="4">
    Fetch all review threads and comments. Save to `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/<branchPath>/`.
    Use the Operations Reference for:
    - "Fetch inline review comments" → save to `inline-comments.json`
    - "Fetch issue comments" → save to `issue-comments.json`
    - "Fetch reviews" → save to `reviews-snapshot.json`
    After fetching, merge the inline and issue comment arrays into a single `threads-snapshot.json`.
    Do NOT use shell append (`>>`) to combine JSON files — read both arrays and merge them programmatically.
  </step>

  <step id="5">
    Classify each review comment/thread:

    - Parse all comments from the snapshot files.
    - For each comment thread:
      1. Check if any reply contains an `AI-APPLY` marker → `explicit-accept`
      2. Check if the author's replies match implicit acceptance patterns → `implicit-accept`
      3. Check if explicitly declined → `rejected`
      4. Otherwise → `ambiguous`
    - For implicit classifications, document the reasoning (which pattern matched, the comment text).
    - Generate classification report at `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/<branchPath>/classification-report.md`:

    ```markdown
    # Feedback Classification Report

    **PR/MR**: #<number> — <title>
    **Date**: <ISO date>
    **Total threads**: <count>

    ## Summary

    - Explicitly accepted (AI-APPLY): <count>
    - Implicitly accepted: <count>
    - Rejected: <count>
    - Ambiguous (skipped): <count>

    ## Explicitly Accepted

    ### Thread #<N>: <file>:<line>
    - **Marker found in**: <comment body excerpt>
    - **Suggestion**: <what the reviewer suggested>
    - **Action**: Will apply

    ## Implicitly Accepted

    ### Thread #<N>: <file>:<line>
    - **Pattern matched**: "<pattern>"
    - **Comment**: "<excerpt>"
    - **Reasoning**: <why this was classified as implicit acceptance>
    - **Action**: Will apply

    ## Ambiguous (Skipped)

    ### Thread #<N>: <file>:<line>
    - **Comment**: "<excerpt>"
    - **Reason skipped**: No clear acceptance or rejection signal

    ## Rejected

    ### Thread #<N>: <file>:<line>
    - **Comment**: "<excerpt>"
    ```
  </step>

  <step id="6">
    Apply accepted changes:

    - For each explicitly and implicitly accepted item:
      1. Read the surrounding code context in the target file (not just the comment text).
      2. Understand the reviewer's suggestion in context.
      3. Apply the change to the local file using edit tools.
    - Log each applied change to `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/<branchPath>/applied-changes.json`:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "threadId": "<id>",
        "classification": "explicit-accept",
        "file": "path/to/file.md",
        "line": 42,
        "description": "What was changed",
        "originalSnippet": "before",
        "newSnippet": "after"
      }
    ]
    ```

    - For any item that cannot be applied (file missing, context changed, ambiguous suggestion):
      - Add to skipped items instead of failing.
      - Document the reason in `skipped-items.md`.
  </step>

  <step id="7">
    Generate skipped items report at `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/<branchPath>/skipped-items.md`:

    ```markdown
    # Skipped Items

    Items that were not applied and require manual attention.

    ## Ambiguous Feedback

    ### Thread #<N>: <file>:<line>
    - **Comment**: "<excerpt>"
    - **Reason**: No clear acceptance signal

    ## Failed to Apply

    ### Thread #<N>: <file>:<line>
    - **Comment**: "<excerpt>"
    - **Reason**: <why it could not be applied>
    ```
  </step>

  <step id="8">
    Report:
    - Summary: how many threads classified, how many accepted/applied/skipped.
    - Project profile applied: mode/modifiers used, or `none` if absent.
    - Files modified by applied changes.
    - Artifacts written under `.samourai/tmpai/review-feedback/<branchPath>/`.
    - Remind user: "Changes are local only. Review the diff, then commit and push manually."
    - If any items were skipped: remind user to check `skipped-items.md`.
  </step>
