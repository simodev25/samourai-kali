# Opencode Agents & Commands Guide

This guide details how to use the Opencode AI ecosystem to plan, implement, and deliver software changes. It covers the
available tools (agents and commands) and describes two primary workflows: **Manual Orchestration** (for hands-on
control) and **Autopilot** (for high-level delegation).

## 1. Overview

Opencode provides a **specification-driven** workflow where AI acts as a co-engineer. The core principle is **Traceability**:
`Business Intent → Change Spec → Implementation Plan → Test Plan → Code → System Spec`

- **Commands** (`/command`): Deterministic macros that perform specific tasks (e.g., generating a file from a template).
- **Agents** (`@agent`): Autonomous roles that can reason, plan, and orchestrate multiple steps or other agents.

## 2. Reference: Agents & Commands

### 2.1 Commands (Automation Macros)

Use these when you want to trigger a specific step in the process.

| Command                  | Description                                                   | When to use                                |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| `/plan-change`           | Interactive session to define a change (scope, goals, risks). | **Step 1**: To start a new feature or fix. |
| `/write-spec <ref>`      | Generates the canonical `chg-<ref>-spec.md` file.             | **Step 2**: After planning is complete.    |
| `/write-test-plan <ref>` | Generates the test strategy `chg-<ref>-test-plan.md`.         | **Step 3**: After the spec is approved.    |
| `/write-plan <ref>`      | Generates the phased `chg-<ref>-plan.md`.                     | **Step 4**: After the test plan.           |
| `/run-plan <ref>`        | Launches the **Coder** to code the active phase.              | **Step 5**: To write code.                 |
| `/review <ref>`          | Launches the **Reviewer** to critique work.                   | **Step 6**: After coding a phase.          |
| `/review-deep <ref>`     | Deep review with a stronger reasoning model.                  | When thorough analysis is needed.          |
| `/sync-docs <ref>`       | Reconciles `.samourai/docai/spec` with the implemented change.            | **Step 7**: Before merging.                |
| `/commit`                | Creates one Conventional Commit.                              | When saving progress.                      |
| `/pr`                    | Creates/updates a PR/MR and syncs title + description.        | When preparing for review/merge.           |
| `/design`                | Generate/update visual identity and UX assets.                | When working on UI/brand assets.           |
| `/plan-decision`         | Interactive session for architectural decisions.              | When a complex trade-off needs an ADR.     |
| `/write-decision`        | Generates the formal decision record (ADR/PDR/TDR/BDR/ODR).  | After the decision session.                |
| `/bootstrap`             | AI-guided project setup for Samourai adoption.                    | When onboarding a new project to Samourai.     |
| `/check`                 | Runs quality gates and summarizes logs to files.              | When you need clean, shareable results.    |
| `/check-fix`             | Runs quality gates and auto-fixes failures.                   | When you want automatic remediation.       |

### 2.2 Agents (Autonomous Roles)

Use these when you need intelligent analysis or orchestration.

| Agent             | Role                                                                                       | Usage                                           |

## 3. Workflow 1: Manual Change Orchestration

In this workflow, **you** act as the lead engineer, triggering each step explicitly. This offers maximum control.

### Step 1: Plan the Change

Start an interactive session to clarify requirements.

```bash
/plan-change [optional-idea-text]
```

_Output_: A structured planning summary in the chat.

### Step 2: Generate the Spec

Turn the planning summary into a canonical file.

```bash
/write-spec <ref>
```

_Output_: `.samourai/docai/changes/.../chg-<ref>-spec.md`

> **Recommendation**: Open the generated `chg-<ref>-spec.md` file and review it carefully. If the requirements (
> acceptance criteria, interface definitions) are incorrect, the downstream plans and code will be incorrect. Edit the
> file directly if needed before proceeding.

### Step 3: Generate Plans

Create the test plan and implementation plan based on the spec.

```bash
/write-test-plan <ref>
/write-plan <ref>
```

_Output_: `chg-<ref>-test-plan.md` and `chg-<ref>-plan.md`

> **Note**: The order is spec → test plan → implementation plan. This ensures the test plan informs implementation priorities.

### Step 4: Implement (Phased Loop)

Execute the plan one phase at a time.

```bash
/run-plan <ref>
```

_Action_: The agent reads the plan, implements the current phase, updates the plan checklist, and runs relevant
validations (for log-heavy runs it may delegate to `@runner`).

### Step 5: Review & Refine

Ask for a code review against the spec.

```bash
/review <ref>
```

_Action_: The reviewer checks code vs. spec. If issues are found, it adds a remediation phase to your plan. You then run
`/run-plan <ref>` again to fix them.

### Step 6: Reconcile Docs

Update the "current truth" documentation.

```bash
/sync-docs <ref>
```

_Action_: Updates `.samourai/docai/spec/**` and `.samourai/docai/contracts/**`.

### Step 7: Finalize

Commit and prepare for merge.

```bash
/commit
/pr
```

`/pr` will create or update the PR/MR for your current branch and write:

- `.samourai/tmpai/pr/<branch>/description.md`

For large branches it may also create `.samourai/tmpai/pr/<branch>/review-plan.md` + `.samourai/tmpai/pr/<branch>/review-log.md` and reuse them
incrementally on reruns. It will not merge; review and merge manually.

If there are uncommitted changes, `/pr` will auto-commit via `@committer` and then push the branch.

## 4. Workflow 2: Autopilot (Product Manager Orchestration)

In this workflow, you act as the **Stakeholder**. You provide the "What" and "Why", and the **PM Agent**
orchestrates the "How" by coordinating other agents.

> **Repo configuration**: `@pm` reads `.samourai/ai/agent/pm-instructions.md` for tracker configuration, labels, and status mapping.
> **Lifecycle reference**: See `.samourai/core/governance/conventions/change-lifecycle.md` for detailed phase-by-phase guidance.

### Step 1: High-Level Handoff

Invoke the PM agent with your requirements or reference a backlog item.

**Direct ticket delivery (recommended):**

```
@pm deliver change GH-123
```

Or with a Jira ticket:

```
@pm deliver change PDEV-456
```

> **Note:** Requires MCP integration with your issue tracker (GitHub or Jira) configured in `.samourai/ai/agent/pm-instructions.md`. The PM agent will fetch ticket details, orchestrate all 10 phases, and create a PR.

**Free-form request (alternative):**

> **User**: "Agent, please act as @pm. I want to add a new 'Dark Mode' feature to the settings page. It
> should persist in the user profile."

### Step 2: PM Orchestration (10 Phases)

The `@pm` orchestrates these phases (see `.samourai/core/governance/conventions/change-lifecycle.md` for details):

1. **clarify_scope** — Ensure requirements are unambiguous; record in `chg-<ref>-pm-notes.yaml`
2. **specification** — Delegate to `@spec-writer` to create `chg-<ref>-spec.md`
3. **test_planning** — Delegate to `@test-plan-writer` to create `chg-<ref>-test-plan.md`
4. **delivery_planning** — Delegate to `@plan-writer` to create `chg-<ref>-plan.md`
5. **delivery** — Invoke `@coder` for implementation (via `/run-plan`)
6. **system_spec_update** — Delegate to `@doc-syncer` to reconcile system docs
7. **review_fix** — Run `@reviewer`; if FAIL, fix and repeat until PASS
8. **quality_gates** — Run builds/tests via `@runner`; fix via `@fixer` if needed
9. **dod_check** — PM verifies all phases complete and all AC satisfied
10. **pr_creation** — Create PR/MR via `@pr-manager`, assign to human, STOP

> **Note**: Phases can be reopened. If PM discovers incomplete work in a later phase, PM reopens the relevant phase.

### Step 3: User Acceptance

The `@pm` will report back when the change is ready for final verification and then STOP.

Before creating/updating the PR/MR, `@pm` runs the **dod_check** phase:

1. Verify all phases completed (check `chg-<ref>-pm-notes.yaml`).
2. Verify all delivery plan tasks complete.
3. Verify all acceptance criteria satisfied.
4. If any gap is found, reopen the appropriate phase.

Then `@pm` creates/updates the PR/MR via `@pr-manager` and stops for user approval and manual merge.
You review and merge manually.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Trust the Artifacts**: Don't try to "prompt" your way through complex coding. Generate the Spec and Plan first. The
  agents work much better when they have a document to follow.
- **One Change at a Time**: Keep changes scoped. If a change gets too big, split it.
- **Review the Spec**: The AI writes the spec, but **you** must read it. If the spec is wrong, the code will be wrong.
- **Use the IDs**: Refer to requirements by ID (e.g., "F-1", "AC-2") when discussing issues with agents.
- **Filesystem is Memory**: Agents rely on the files in `.samourai/docai/changes/`. Do not delete them until the change is merged
  and settled.
- **Tracker is Source of Truth**: The external tracker (Jira/GitHub) owns workflow status. `@pm` syncs status via MCP;
  Git artifacts support implementation and auditability but do not replace tracker state.
- **PM Notes are Mandatory**: Every change must have a `chg-<ref>-pm-notes.yaml` file for tracking phases, decisions, and open questions.
